Name: Valentine's Day, Saint Valentine's Day
Today I want to talk about Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's day.
It's a holiday for honoring Saint Valentine,
and now it is also a day associated with romantic love.

History: Saint Valentine is christian bishop lived 2000
thousand years ago in Roman Empire.
Emperor Claudius The Second made a law that no soldiers can get married.
But Saint Valentine decided to let soldiers get married in his church.
So Emperor put him in prison and executed him on February 14 in the year 270.

After 18th century, Valentine's day became a day for lovers to express their love
for each other by presenting flowers, candy and Valentine's day cards.
Now it gains world-wide popularity, and is celebrated all around the world.
